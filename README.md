### Reflection on Iteration 3 - Cory Bretsch/Evan Davis

**Approach to Designing Iteration 3:**
Iteration 3 lacked an interaction pattern so we focused on the previous classes and the examples provided
1. **Requirements:**
   - Ensuring that the game follows the BattleShip rules.
2. **Game Flow:**
   - Designing the main game loop to handle the sequence of gameplay: setup, player turns, computer turns, and game end conditions.
3. **Using Existing Classes:**
   - Leveraging existing `Ship`, `Cell`, and `Board` classes to manage game state and logic.
4. **User Input:**
   - Developing methods to handle user input for ship placement and firing shots.
   - Providing clear and informative feedback to the user based on their actions.
5. **Checking For Errors:**
   - Implementing checks to validate user inputs and handle invalid scenarios gracefully.

**What I Would Work on with One More Day:**
If given an additional day we would do the following:
1. **Better UI:**
   - Bigger and more visually appealing game board.
2. **Computer:**
   - Having the computer use strategy instead of random shot placement.
3. **More Game Features:**
   - Adding more ship sizes.
4. **Developer Empathy:**
   - Adding more comments for better readability. 

**Pairing Techniques:**
During the project, we used several pairing strategies:
1. **Ping-Pong Pairing:**
   - Alternating roles where one person writes tests and other writes code and then switch.
2. **Async:**
   - Working separetely and keeping contact through slack

**Feedback Sharing:**
Feedback was shared:
1. **Code Reviews:**
   - Conducting code reviews 
2. **Slack Hudles:**
   - Meeting up to discuss code and planning
